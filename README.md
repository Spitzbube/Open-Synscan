This is a software to run on a ESP8266 to control 2 step motors and work with Skywatcher SynScan protocol using WIFI connection.

Tested with EQMOD and Android Synscan PRO.

EQMOD only works with serial comm port, so SerialCom2Wifi app must be used (check the project on github).

Hardware schematics are available here:

3d print models available also available in "3dFiles" folder.
